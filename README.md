# parallel_grasta
A project guided by Prof. Laura Balzano at the University of Michigan. The goal 
of this project to implement GRASTA (Grassmannian Robust Adaptive Subspace 
Tracking Algorithm) leveraging GPU hardware with CUDA. More information about 
GRASTA can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/hejunzz/grasta

The subdirectories contain the source for various projects I currently have going
in VS2012. The all have third-party dependencies that I will list in the 
accompanying README file for each.
